# Load-N-Sort

This is a JavaFX program that I wrote for class that reads and writes files and performs certain sorting methods on them. It also has functionality for a Traveling Salesman Problem.

For some reason I am unable to extract all the files properly from the JAR file. I don't have the original code otherwise.

Created in NetBeans IDE 8.2
